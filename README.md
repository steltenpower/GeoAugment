# Overthere

Physical addresses, coordinates or maps in any webpage can be enriched with information.

Technically:
- browser extension that detects (schema.org/address), suggests (regex guessing) and allows for manual selection of the geographical location.
- Gives information in that webpage, on hover or in a new browser tab (automatically or after user interaction). Depending preferences.
- Anything is possible for related information, as it will have a plug-in structure

Some suggestions for that anything:
- air pollution data and location of sources
- fastest bike route there from current GPS(-like) position, compared to driving including traffic and parking
- likelihood of being underwater because of sea level rise
- likelihood of droughts and floodings (based on soil layers and climate)
- solar energy potential
- noise data (partially from explane.org app?)
