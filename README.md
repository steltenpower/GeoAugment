# Overthere

User Interaction:
- Physical addresses, coordinates or maps in any webpage you are merely a visitor of, can be enriched with location-based information of your current interests.

Technically:
- browser extension that detects (schema.org/address), suggests (regex guessing), and allows for manual selection of the geographical location or area.
- Injects icons with a score within the webpage, depending preferences. The icon is also where you can find a configuration menu.
- Anything is possible for related information, as it will have a plug-in structure

Some suggestions for data to enrich with:
- air pollution data and location of sources (Tropomi, PlumeLabs, samenmeten.nl, etc.). Even more interesting at the moment because of a correlation with COVID-19.
- fastest bike route there from current GPS(-like) position, compared to driving including traffic and parking
- likelihood of being underwater because of sea level rise
- likelihood of droughts and floodings (based on soil layers and climate)
- solar energy potential
- noise data (partially from explane.org app?)
- nearest vegan restaurant, train station, play garden, etc.
- crime risks
- soil data
- land registry

## Possible side effects
- People browsing for a house to buy, within that flow see the air quality overthere and change decisions because of that.
- People consider air quality more important as they don't want to have trouble selling their house in the future.
- Companies consider air quality more important as they don't want difficulty attracting paying visitors or personnel.
