# Overthere

Physical addresses, coordinates or maps (careful with different projections) in any webpage can be enriched with information.

Technically:
- browser extension that detects (schema.org/address), suggests (regex guessing) and allows for manual selection of the geographical location.
- Gives information in that webpage, on hover or in a new browser tab (automatically or after user interaction). Depending preferences.
- Anything is possible for related information, as it will have a plug-in structure

Some suggestions for that anything:
- air pollution data and location of sources
- fastest bike route there from current GPS(-like) position, compared to driving including traffic and parking
- likelihood of being underwater because of sea level rise
- likelihood of droughts and floodings (based on soil layers and climate)
- solar energy potential
- noise data (partially from explane.org app?)
- nearest vegan restaurant, train station, play garden, etc.


## Possible side effects

People browsing for a house to buy, within that flow see the air quality overthere and change decisions because of that.
People consider air quality more important as they don't want to have trouble selling their house in the future.
Companies consider air quality more important as they don't want difficulty attracting paying visitors or personnel.
